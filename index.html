      <section class="experience" id="work"><h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
      <p>I have done the Mayors Summer Youth Employment program for 4 summers in a row, with 2 of those summers being at the same site, <i>Boys II Men</i>. I also currently have a Co-op with the Amazon-owned company <i>Audible</i>, helping them in the DataQA team. I played basketball at CRLS for 3 years, from freshman year to junior year, playoing junior varsity as a sophomore and junior. During the 2023 summer, I volunteered at a program called Soccer Nights, where kids ages 4-13 could get a chance to learn about the sport. I have included my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeVH6qkvFPC59Ibag7jMl_s7NNR29dhC1pGf_gLkqyk/edit?usp=sharing"<i>here</i></a>.</p>
